        <p>
          The objective of the game is to connect four of your colored discs in
          a row before your opponent does. You win by being the first player to
          form four in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

        <ol class="rule-list">
          <li>
            <span>1</span>Red always goes first and places one of their discs on
            the bottom row of the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2</span>Each player takes turns placing their discs on the
            board, with only 30 seconds to make a move.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>3</span> Players must place their discs on the lowest
            available space in the column they choose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>4</span> The first player to get four of their discs in a row
            (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) gets 1 point.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>5</span> If no player gets four in a row, the game is a draw
            and no one gets a point. Reset the board and play again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>6</span> The first player to reach 3 points wins the game.
          </li>
